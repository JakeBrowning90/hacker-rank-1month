# HackerRank 1 Month Preparation Kit workbook

## Overview
This is a repo of my solutions and notes as I complete the 1 Month Preparation Kit on HackerRank. It will serve as a remote home for the skills I'm practicing, a way of tracking my developing coding knowledge, and a way to keep making GitHub commits while I devote time to these kinds of challenges instead of just working on projects.

If you happen to find this repo and have not yet completed the challenges, please be honest and do not peek until you've tried your own solution. It can be frustrating, but I believe in you!
